  <h1>Batagor</h1>
  <p>Batagor is also Indonessia delicacy that I really like while growing up as a child. It is a mix of fried dimsum and deep fried tofu drizzled with peanut sauce. Yes, I am addicted to peanut sauce.</p>
  <p>First thing we need to prepare is the basic ingredints:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>14 oz 396 gr extra firm tofu</li>
    <li>15 -20 wonton wrappers</li>
    <li>1 recipe for crispy batter</li>
    <li>Cooking oil for deep frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Meat/fish paste:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>300 gr ground chicken meat or fish paste</li>
    <li>100 gr tapioca flour</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>½ tsp sugar</li>
    <li>¼ tsp white pepper powder</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Peanut sauce:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>200 gr roasted unsalted peanuts</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>150 gr palm sugar I use coconut sugar (darker color)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>250 ml water</li>
    <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Ground the peanuts and garlic in the food processor. Transfer into a saucepan and add in the rest of the ingredients. Bring to a boil and then lower the heat to let it simmer for another 15 minutes. Let it cool down and can be stored in a jar and kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 week</li>
    <li>Cut the tofu into 8 pieces. Scoop out the middle (as shown in the photo above). Finely chop the tofu that you scoop out so you can mix this with the meat/fish paste later (no waste)</li>
    <li>Place the meat/fish paste, tofu that you scoop out earlier and the rest of the ingredients for meat paste in a large bowl. Mix until the mixture forms a paste and sticky</li>
    <li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Scoop a small portion of the meat/fish paste and boil in the water until cooked through. Have a taste. Add more salt and/or sugar to your meat/fish paste if necessary</li>
    <li>Scoop the meat/fish paste into the hole you create on the tofu earlier. Make sure you pack the meat in. Place one scoop of meat/fish paste in the middle of the wonton skin and then gather the sides and gently pinch to seal on top. Repeat with the rest</li>
    <li>Bring the water in the steamer to a boil. Arrange the tofu and siomay on a plate and steam for the next 20 minutes or until the meat/fish paste is cooked through. Remove from the steamer and let them cool down for at least 15 minutes before deep-frying</li>
    <li>Preheat enough oil for deep frying. Coat each piece of tofu and siomay with the batter and then fry until crispy and golden brown all over. Remove and place on absorbent paper towel and keep them warm in the oven</li>
    <li>Cut the fried tofu into smaller pieces. You can leave the siomay whole, or cut them in half too, it's up to you. Topped with the peanut sauce, a drizzle of kecap manis,  your favorite Indonesian sambal (like sambal ABC for example), and squeeze of fresh lime juice. Enjoy!!</li>
